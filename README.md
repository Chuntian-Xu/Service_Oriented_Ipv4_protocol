# OMNeT++/INET Service-Oriented-IPv4
Implement the Service-Oriented-Ipv4-Protocol based on OMNeT++/INET  
(Simulation of Service-Oriented Maritime IoT Machine-Type Communication Network Architecture)
# Version of OMNeT++/INET
	Operating system: Architecture_1,3,4(Windows10-64/Ubuntu18.04.6 LTS); Architecture_2(Ubuntu18.04.6 LTS)
	OMNeT++ 5.6.2
	INET 4.2.5
# Directory Structure
	Client-Server Application:
		Architecture_1: The service header contains Service_ID and Client_ID
		Architecture_2: The service header contains Service_ID

# Usage
1. Copy the program files in the program folder to the same folder as the complete INET module source file path;
2. If there is no corresponding path in the source file, create a new folder according to the path of the program file in the program folder, and then copy the program into it;
3. Rebuild
